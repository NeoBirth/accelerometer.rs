//! Generic embedded-friendly accelerometer support, including traits and types
//! for representing readings from 2 or 3-axis accelerometers.
//!
//! Also includes optional device position tracking support with statistical
//! methods for smoothing out noisy accelerometer data.
//!
//! ## Writing an accelerometer driver
//!
//! The `accelerometer` crate is intended to provide a "HAL" for accelerometers
//! which allows several accelerometer-consuming crates to leverage a common
//! API and set of vector types for consuming accelerometer data.
//!
//! Accelerometer drivers are intended to use `embedded-hal` I2C or SPI
//! interfaces. The first task of writing a driver is to choose one of these
//! and write a driver which is able to communicate with the accelerometer and
//! obtain data.
//!
//! Next, impl the [`Accelerometer`] trait (providing normalized readings) and/or
//! the [`RawAccelerometer`] trait (providing direct access to raw data) for
//! your driver (ideally the former, as it provides reuse across drivers).
//!
//! For [`RawAccelerometer`], you will need to choose a [`Vector`] type for
//! raw accelerometer data which best matches the output of your device.
//! This trait has a single method, [`RawAccelerometer::accel_raw`], which
//! returns a reading from the accelerometer or an error.
//!
//! See the [ADXL343 crate] for an example.
